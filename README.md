# cats.typed

org.clojure/core.typed definitions for funcool/cats library


[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/cats.typed.svg)](https://clojars.org/cats.typed)


## Notes
This library is not yet finished. As for know there are annotations for:
* cats.monad.either
* cats.monad.identity
* cats.monad.exception
* cats.monad.maybe

## Issues:
* cats.typed annotation are written as a proof of concept - be aware that they might not be correct
* core.typed cannot read conditional monads and do not discover *.cljc files

## Contribution
Feel free to create merge request.
